# PROBA-V-S1-S10-product-Matlab-reader
A matlab script for reading the PROBA-V S1/S10 products in an easy and handy way. It is developed because there was a high need from end users to be able to extract and read the PROBA-V images and convert them to an easy format to work with (e.g standard IDL/ENVI format).
